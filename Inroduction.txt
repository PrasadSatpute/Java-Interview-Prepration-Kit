My name is Prasad Satpute. 
I am from Nagpur, and I currently live in Pune.

I have been working as a Java Developer in the service industry for the past two years. 
I have experience in Java, SQL, and frameworks like Spring Boot. 
I have also worked with databases such as MySQL and Oracle DB, and tools like Docker and Git for version control. 
Additionally, I have experience with Apache Kafka in Spring Boot and microservices.

Most of my work has been in the banking domain. 
My latest project was the Multi Bureau Connector and Hunter for the Bank of Maharashtra. 
In this project, I was the Lead Developer with a team of five members. 
I developed REST APIs to fetch data from multiple bureaus and store it in the bank's database. 
I used Spring Security and JWT Authentication for securing the APIs.

On a typical day, I start by reviewing the code I worked on the previous day and the latest code checkouts. 
I attend sprint task meetings and, by the end of the day, report my work and updates, which include client requests and any code changes.

That's a brief overview of me.
